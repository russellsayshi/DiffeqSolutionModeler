# DiffeqSolutionModeler
Simple little Java app to model solutions to constant-coefficient matrices of differential equations

Does stuff like this:

and this:

to help visualize solutions to constant-coefficient systems of differential equations, however it is easily modded to work on any type of system of differential equations.

Currently, use the `QuickNDirty.java` because I have to go fast and make use of it before my quiz. I'm developing a much more full-fledged version though as you can see in the `src/` directory. Hopefully I'll have time to finish this before diffeq is over!
